Welcome to the RPG game!
This game is a text-based adventure that allows you to explore a fantasy world, complete quests, and fight monsters as you progress through the story.
As you explore the world, you will encounter various NPCs (non-player characters) who will offer quests for you to complete. These quests may involve retrieving an item, defeating a certain number of enemies, or solving a puzzle. Completing quests will reward you with experience points, which will allow you to level up and become more powerful. In addition to completing quests, you will also encounter monsters as you explore the world. You can choose to fight them or try to run away, but be warned: the monsters in this game are not easy to defeat! Be sure to use your abilities and items wisely in combat to give yourself the best chance of victory.
